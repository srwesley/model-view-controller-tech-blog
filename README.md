# Model View Controller - Tech Blog
Assignment application for Week 14 - Model View Controller for bootcamp

## Task
Creating a full stack application using the MVC model as well as node.js libraries such as bcrypt/bcryptjs, connect-session-sequelize, dotenv, express, express-handlebars, express-session, mysql2, and sequelize. Also used other dependencies such as eslint, eslint-config-prettier, and prettier. 

This all displays as a tech blog where the user can either log in (if they've already signed up for an account) or sign up for an account, and create blog posts - which are then displayed on the homepage and can be seen whether or not someone is logged in. There is also a feature to comment on other's posts - however, for some reason, I couldn't get that feature to work, and the console wouldn't display any errors or any notable responses. This will be fixed in the near future. Otherwise, other features include being able to go into existing blog posts that the user posted, and they can both either update or delete those posts.
